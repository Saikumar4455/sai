JavaScript Data Types
	JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:
	let length = 16;                               // Number
	let lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
	let x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object
	
The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

JavaScript Types are Dynamic
     JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
JavaScript Strings
 A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
 Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:	 

JavaScript Numbers
	JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
	Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:
what is JavaScript Booleans?
	Booleans can only have two values: true or false. 
The type of Operator
  You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
  The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:	
what is Undefined?
	In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
what is Empty Values?
  An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
  An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
