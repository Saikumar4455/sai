JavaScript Variables
4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
	Using var
	Using let
	Using const
	Using nothing

What are Variables?
  Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).  
  In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:	
When to Use JavaScript var?
  Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
  The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
  The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
  If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
When to Use JavaScript const?
  If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
  If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
  In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables: 
JavaScript Identifiers
  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
  These unique names are called identifiers.
  Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    Names must begin with a letter
	Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
	Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
	Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names 
The Assignment Operator
	In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
	This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
Declaring a JavaScript Variable
	Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
	You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:	
One Statement, Many Variables
	You can declare many variables in one statement.
	Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:	
Value = undefined
	In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
	A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
	The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables
  If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
  The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:
JavaScript Dollar Sign $
  Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:
JavaScript Underscore (_)
  Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:
